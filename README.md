# Practicum-2025

The principal health-related question I am interested in answering is: What are the health impacts of air pollutants and their complex "mixture effects"? Specifically, I aim to study the associations between mortality as the outcome of interest with the mixture of ozone, PM2.5, and NO2 levels, as the exposure of interest in order to create models to predict the effects of such exposures on this outcome. I plan to use a combined approach using weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression with the help of quantile g-computation to look at the differences in mortality at the county level based on the exposure mixture level. Additionally, this project will focus on counties within New York state and the following year range: 2000-2016.
